Application Summary: This portfolio showcases my work, various projects, skills, and contact info.

Technologies used:
- Figma
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Sass
- Sass Folder Architecture
- JQuery
- Google Analytics
- Git
- Github

Problems Encountered:
- it was difficult determining where to start because there was a specific layout and specs that needed to me included. I used milanote and figma to organize my thoughts
- it was difficult developing the media queries for various screen sizes especially mobile being that I developed for web first

Future Developments: 
- add more projects as I keep developing
- create a module that opens when a user hovers and click on a project
- when the module opens up display a short video of the application in action and a short summary
